### History Long Past

Long long ago, as was all of Thiusland, the east was the domain of gigantic elemental beings. The area was then mostly covered by a large lake inhabited by earth and water giants who slowly shaped the land closer to what it is now. But when a great fire threatened the great Urboral tree, the giants rallied against it, and fought fiercely in an attempt to save the primeval tree, sadly to no avail. Most of the water elementals perished in the battle and the remaining earth giants, overrun by sorrow, laid down in defeat on the eastern edge of what is now called the plains and the north, forming the great mountain chain that now borders the bogs. Although most of the earth elementals fell into a deep slumber, not all of them rested. Slirabh, the giant serpent of rock and stone whose body makes up a jagged mountain range rising a hundred meters high into the sky, was still awake. Its sorrow gave it a purpose, and inhabited by that purpose, it stands as a guardian of the nature of Thiusland against all forces who might threaten it.

Some time passed, and some tenacious and magic-welding lizards, escaping from the clutches of the dragons ravaging their homeland, made the journey across the shifting stones on the back of Slirabh to end up at the bogs of the east.Thirty or so lizardfolk, members of two families, who joined together for the journey travelled in relative harmony. Their voyage was well chronicled by Zliphia, who made great mention of the cooperation between the two families, freely sharing their spells in a way wizards of their homeland never did. This uncommon collaboration was instrumental to their survival. While only ten of the original travellers made it, the ones who did found welcoming wetlands filled with insects, open land, and tree cover that was like paradise to them.

The ten original survivors of the journey were split between two families; the Viparas and the Skinks. Those who considered themselves a part of the Skink family settled down early on and built a small village in a protected glade away from the rocky ridges. The Vipara on the other hand, after some debate, gathered some supplies and grew their numbers over eight years in preparation for an expedition far into the bogs. 

During their journey, the Vipara first went west, using the stars as a guide. At this time, Thiusland was ruled by beasts, giants were in their early years and elves still roamed freely. 
As they would rest at night around a campfire, the lizardfolk were reading the stars and interpreting their celestial secrets which they used to deepen their folk magic practice.
Unbeknownst to them, the elves were watching and following the lizardfolk along their journey, marvelling at their ingenuity in star-reading and spell craft that seemed to come as second nature to them.They were also pleased with the diplomacy they demonstrated when meeting the snakes of the eastern hills, which we now know as slitherskins, and how quickly the two found an understanding. 

Back at the foot of the mountains, the Skinks had built wooden walls and fences around their shelters, taking the wood from a forest they found north. From that fort they would venture out and hunt large insectoids to sustain themselves and gather materials and plants from the woods. They quickly became skilled hunters in the treacherous bogs and saw martial prowess as a paragon of value. Storytelling and the gathering of knowledge grew in importance in their culture, for hunting routes and fighting techniques could be shared through stories, as well as  preserved in intricate sculptures that would illustrate the best hunting routes. In three decades, they had built a system of marks inscribed on bark that would be the basis of the written Repitilenoid language and the first form of writing in Thiusland.



Around the third decade, the Vipara were now on the southern shore and were met by an elven spirit accompanied by strange pink skinned and hairy creatures they called gnomes. The elves insisted that the lizardfolk bring the gnomes with them back to their main city in the east, as they could teach them lots. The Vipara gladly accepted as their curiosity towards these people was unmatched, and together they started the long walk back home. Along the journey the gnomes spoke of their inventions and ways of farming, techniques and concepts the likes of which the Vipara had never heard of, and the gnomes observed as the magical acuity of their hosts never ceased to amaze them. The Vipara returned thirty six years from the day they left to the glade and introduced the gnomes to the few Vipara who stayed behind and now lived on the outskirts of the grand fortress of the Skinks: Xedoc.

### The Recent Past

In the immediate aftermath of the return of the Vipara accompanied by the gnomes to the families sharing the bogs there was unease, but it settled as the gnomes were truly impressed by the Skinks’ building and writing and showed respect towards their way of life, the Skinks though gave no grace to the gnomes in return. To calm tensions, the Vipara and the gnomes built their lodgings away from the Skink’s fortress into the boggy surroundings, developing homes sitting on long wooden stilts and adapted the gnomic agricultural practices to work within the wet and swampy environment. The cultivating of quiff swelled the insect population, the planting of Kozom trees in nurseries brought many birds and the east saw a half-century of prodigious growth in population from these efforts. This population boom was shared amongst the Skinks and the Vipara but as the Skinks in Xedoc struggled more as a result of it, as the now much more common prey threatened their hunting tradition and their fortress became crowded and living conditions deteriorated as the population swelled. And so, as discontent grew in the fortified city, the Skinks grew resentful of the Vipara who seemed to have no such issues.

The Skinks attacked at daybreak, and destroyed tens of stilted homes while Vipara and gnomes were still fast asleep. They held them to a violent ultimatum; submit to the rule of the Skinks or be exiled. The Vipara called for the gnomes, since with their long lives most of their elders remembered life under dragon’s rule. Their wisdom was that the Skinks could be reasoned with if given enough time so they accepted submission under the promise of no further bloodshed. 
The Skinks extended the walls and defences of Xedoc to encompass the villages built by the Viparas and the gnomes, and claimed the combined settlement as one city under their protection. And under the rule of the Skinks, the Vipara grew closer to the gnomes who got relegated to the outskirts, having developed new spells and cultural touchstones in their years together. 

The ruling Skinks worried of revolution coming from their subjugated siblings so they tried to insert a wedge between the gnomes and the lizardfolk in order to disrupt the harmony existing among them. A decree was passed making all lizardfolk equal to each other, but also have a higher status than folks of other races in their now proclaimed Repitalian Republic. It is also during these tumultuous times that the Republic saw slitherskins arrive, as well as desperate lizardfolk who came to Thiusland by boat to the south and a retinue of salamander folk of green and black colorations. The immediate and open assimilation of these newcomers irked the gnomes who had been part of this society for generations now and were still treated as lesser, but the final straw was when the new salamanders were given land that had been passed down in a gnome family for over a hundred years. The gnomes rose up in protest, using illusion magic to scare back and intimidate the lizardfolk enforcers. The ruling Skink family was put on the backfoot and in this hour of unease a Salamander man by the name of Vivonox caught the ear of the Skinks and began drumming up support for a full raid on the gnomish people, with intent to kill. The night of the raid came and a mob of two hundred salamanders and Skinks went to the gnomish neighborhood to burn it down but found it empty, the gnomes gone, their crops harvested and their stores barren. In secret, those who still considered themselves Vipara earned the gnomes' trust and smuggled them out of the city to the north, beyond the bogs, hoping for them to find a better life there.

The salamanders and the newly arrived lizardfolk were sent out on duty of restarting the farming in the wake of losing the gnomes, but their knowledge and ways of doing was lost, or, more so, hidden by the Vipara who kept detailed records of all the techniques, technologies, stories and names of the gnomes during their time with them. The Skinks grew frustrated with the inability of their new allies and the newcomers grew angry at being pressured to provide for an ungrateful upper class. The Vipara pushed at the divide as much as they could and finally massive protests broke out all over Xedoc coming to the old fortress gates, to the home of Skinks. Faced with numbers they couldn't hope to withstand the Skinks parlayed and an agreement was made that all the people of the big city would vote for their government, that any and all would be welcome in the bogs, and that no group could hold de facto power over another. With this parley came a week of deliberations and talks which were recorded in writing for the coming generations. It set the stage for a new era of the bogs in which the people would rule.
