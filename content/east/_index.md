The bogs of the east form an area of livable land between the plains and the rocky ridges that denote the easternmost edge of Thiusland. Surrounded by mountainous and rocky ridges on all sides, it’s a moist area of wet and foggy winters, hot and humid summers and otherwise rainy weather covered by large areas of dotted thin forests and many placid bogs. Such a place is favourable to insects, birds and reptiles of many kinds, so much so that it became a hub of power to the first government of Thiusland.
