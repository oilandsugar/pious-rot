Description: 
The Lorn have long and fat bodies like the most idle of nobles, crowned with a furry head many have deemed darling. They are an autumnal orange and make a yapping howl in the morn.
Behaviour:
They will live in the waters near a settlement, eating happily the fish bones and scraps they can find or the voles that would otherwise find their way into food stores. They send most the day in water, and then at night they wither onto the land and into the villages to scavenge.
Relationship with locals:
Lorn have become one with the northerns in many ways. They are known to give attention to a person regardless of wish or intent and will return to this person hone each night without fail. They also will move into a settlement to avoid predators if they are nearby in the water. Some find their morning chattering annoying but most Northerns are well use to it.
Folktale:
There’s a long told myth in the north that the Lorn were once the ones in the villages of the North, a tribe of peoples who praised the sun but were envious of its power. It is said this tribe made a fell ritual to pull the sun from the sky and control it, but the Sun escaped and punished the tribe by changing them into Lorn. This is why they wish so badly to live near villages and only come out at night. 
Stats:
(System Agnostic)

Attributes:
The lorn is an adept swimmer but clumsy on land but with their large bodies they have the strength of an equivalent-sized human. They are not too bright or the wisest of creatures but their unassuming nature and dopish looks often ingratiate them to the locals as either tolerated pests or often as pets. Their looks also help those they trick with their mimicking whines of need to forgive them after finding out they’ve been deceived by a lorn.
Hunting Ability:
Hunting is not the arena that the lorn excels in, preferring to find food that has been left being or to steal food that is not being watched over carefully enough, there have been recorded instances of lorn in the wild that hunt small prey like rats and small fish but that is only at their most desperate. Any creature that willingly offers a lorn their food will immediately gain the favour of the beast, possibly so much so that the creature may regret giving them the food in the first place.
