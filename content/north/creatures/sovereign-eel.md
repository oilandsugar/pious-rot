The Sovereign Eel is a creature of grand size, as long as two Northerner boats. They have white and grey marbled skin, four eyes inset into fleshy faces and two long whiskers with barbed ends.  

The Eel is a solitary hunter, living alone after the larva stage and hunting around a chosen cave or crevasse. They hunt all intelligent creatures in the wild but their main food source is the Iceflow Whale. Using innate mind alerting powers they will dominate prey to come to them.  

Sovereign Eels live in underwater caves and sunken ships, preferring to stay hidden from prey while they dominate their mind. They will not travel past a certain temperature of water and are never seen in the shallows or rivers.  

They will attack fishers if provoked but are known to respond well to offerings and difference. They are smart and will run from larger groups of hunters, trying to draw them into splitting up where the eel can deal with them one by one.

Sovereign eels are dauntingly powerful creatures with a tough and thick hide covering a long body that they use to move surprisingly quickly underwater. They can eat almost any organic matter but prefer living prey, they show an understanding of complex concepts, and personalities, and seem to communicate with one another in ways that often seem odd to such a monstrosity.
 
When they are hunting they hide in caves and behind rocky debris to surprise the aim of their hunt, it’s said that when you notice a sovereign eel it’s already too late. If you’re caught near the awesome beast you will feel your mind begin to betray you to thoughts that don’t always seem your own, it can even command prey to move closer to it so it’s easier to catch. Once in its reach, it will strike with barbed appendages near its mouth that pierce not only the body but the mind, causing their victim to freeze in place with a cold terror, though it is said the strong-willed can overcome such a fear. Once held in this freezing fear the eel will bite down on its victim and call for its young to feed as well.
If the sovereign eel fears for its life after confronting something stronger then it will attempt to flea to protect its life and the life of its brood. The psychic assault of the sovereign eel will go from a soft prodding to a heavy-handed beat as it assaults the minds of those that threaten it to not know who is a friend and who is a foe, and hoping to use the confusion to escape.
