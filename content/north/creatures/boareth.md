A lithe creature larger than most hounds, covered in dark and slick feathers save for near its eyes, where it is white. From its head a sharp wedge of a break, lined with razor like edges. Most will not see it hunting then but will hear it’s snort and growl  

Boareth are the apex predators of the North, they live on hunting the various species of birds that live on the rocky shores of the north. They are agile climbers, finding their way with ease to the various cliff side nests these birds inhabit. They hunt in packs of 4, no more, no less and prefer to pounce down on their targets.  

Boareth will relocate where needed for food, some travelling longer distances than most adventures in their lives. They sleep on high rocks where they can survey the land for threats and the skies for prey. They will retreat to caves when they give birth, and protect their young there for a year.  

Boareth are hunters and as such they are not scared to kill any hell creature they see as helpless, and so any creatures child is not safe near one. In the full hunting group of four they will challenge villagers in groups of lesser numbers but will quickly retreat if outnumbered or flanked.  

Boarbeth have long memories. It’s well known that if you steal one’s prey or harm it that the Boarbeth will stalk you until it gets its revenge, sometimes waiting years to strike, but strike it shall.


## Stats

(System Agnostic)

### Attributes

Boarbeth are versatile hunters that use speed, stealth, and efficiency for a hunt over brute strength, often choosing the more advantageous area to attack its prey. They will often move quickly up and over rugged and rock covered terrain to then pounce on it’s prey. This favours the boarbeth as their fur and feathered hide does not provide the best of armour, especially against the stone and metal weapons of the Northerners. 

#### Hunting Ability:

If faced one-on-one in pitched combat the fight will favour the skilled hunter, this is why boarbeth prefers to hunt in packs of four. With prey that is distracted the boarbeth can line up it’s devastating beak to bite down on the weakest points of a creature and hit for a devastating painful blow. However, if a creature can withstand this attack the boarbeth are often confused and agitated and will try to retreat to heights to attack again when the prey is again at a disadvantage.
