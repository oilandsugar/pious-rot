Description: 
Standing as tall as a man, Ronrath Kobal are always hunched, walking on knuckles of large a muscular front arms with two long claws and walking in squat back legs. Their mouth is hidden by fur but opens terrifyingly wide when they feel threatened.
Behaviour:
Docile in nature and very slow, the Ronrath   Kobal has been mistaken for boulders in the winter after being covered in snow that has settled on their nearly still forms. Often found in the shallows of stoney beaches, hunting for crabs. They are most active in lightning storms, responding to the bloom of their favourite food, the Thunder Revel. 
Habitat:
Ronrath Kobal sleep in low brush lands in groups of 3 - 5 and claim a territory on hillside where Thunder Revel grows. They accept others of their kind when fishing but will get defensive if any approach their den or garden. They enjoy tundras and high mountain areas.
Relationship with locals:
Ronrath Kobals are curious of others when they are younger but grow to indifference as they age. They will not harm another unless they are scared for themselves or their offspring, or feeding during a lightning storm.
The Ronrath Kobal is a strange beast of the North. It’s surprisingly large for the available food source but makes up for this by spending most of its day nearly completely still. This also aids in it’s hunting of crabs, standing in the shallows and waiting for them to settle around it to strike. They will not attacked unless provoked or spooked, which can happen if touched or bumped while hunting. In the winter, with snow accumulated on them, Travellers and the newcomers to the north often mistake a hunting sloth for a rock in the water. They also are aggressively protective of Thunder Revel plants, a flower that blooms only in lightning storms and that seems to be addictive to the Ronrath Kobal.
During a thunderstorm the Ronrath Kobal will be the most active in its life, running from flower to flower in its territory to enjoy the flowers of the Thunder Revel. Often what one counts as their territory overlaps with another and a fight will ensue.
Ronrath Kobals fight one another with a staggering charge, leaving their deadly claws for what it considers food.
The creature breaks crab shells with its two large claws on its front legs, these claws also assist with digging for roots in the cold hard dirt of winter. 
The name Skyfire Sloth is a clumsy translation from the Northern dialect, sloth is the closest translation to the northern word for something that pretends to be inanimate, often used as an insult for the lazy. 

Stats:
(System Agnostic)

Attributes:
The skyfire sloth is one of the strongest creatures in the north, having impressive muscles from a life spent in majority standing and conserving energy for bursts of activity, but otherwise is a lumbering beast. They are not the most intelligent of creatures, but they have a strong sense of their habitat and can use natural landmarks to situation themselves. They are a terrifying sight to behold, with matted fur and ragged claws.
Hunting Ability:
The only time a skyfire sloth is truly hunting is when it needs to find or defend its patch of thunder revel. During a time of thunder revel bloom the creature moves at a terrifying speed that it’s never seemingly able to conjure unless somehow tricked into thinking there is a thunderstorm. It uses its large claws to maim any other sloth or creature foolish enough to approach it at this time, attacking in quick succession. When not protecting it’s most lauded food a threatened or angered skyfire sloth is prone to simply falling onto a threat and once pinned down and easy to catch it will begin ripping at it with it’s lower set of clawed feet.
