Jolla Half-fin, a 39-year-old fisher from Totindell, grew up in the northern lands with her father and sister after losing her mother and brothers to the rebellion. During the festival of Renewing Fire she was chosen by the flames to journey for one year and she gladed accepted her fate

After half a year of adventure she met a gilded ship of eastern artists and apprentices. The artists, with painted faces, strong perfumes and adorned in silks and gold, treated her as an oddity. The delighted in asking her all manner of questions but seemingly mocking her northern ways. Yet one apprentice, Luciallos, saw her discomfort. They bonded over their doubts and dreams—Luciallos uncertain about serving the god of the wind, and Half-fin longing for home’s warmth amid the south’s cold indifference.

It's said that the two fought off every artist and soldier in the east to escape with their love and their  lives, it's said they used the wayfarer spark to burn the whole eastern navy. These are all stories however as together, they became Totindell’s beloved storytellers, sharing tales of the world beyond at many a table of Totindell while keeping a wary eye on the horizon for gilded ships.
