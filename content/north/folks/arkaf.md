In the forest of Fahlor a single arborist from the family Arborist works tirelessly at a now rare art. Arkaf, a member of the giant family, came to the north 30 years prior to tend the dryads and trees in the forest that it seems, if the ancient dryads are to be believed, was started by the now extinct northern giants. Now with the forests of the central plains all burnt to the ground Arkaf is working to bring much needed wood in trade from the north to the plains and to bring forests of the plains back.
  
Arkaf is a dryad caller, and as such she makes a pact with a dryad of a dying tree to move them to a new vessel. What's special is she seals their soul as magical energy into the wood of the tree, writing a runic contact on the trunk itself, to be transported to the central plains. The northerners then fell the tree and guide it down the river to the central plains. Once arrived on the shores of the budding forest of the western plains a member of the Arborist family transfers the soul of the dryad from the log to a new sapling there. The log is then traded with the giants for their exceptional stone, and claywork to be brought back to the north. 
  
Arkaf is highly respected by their family and is being asked to return as a matriarch to lead the family but she states she's as much a northerner as an Arborist.
