Many ghosts haunt the former battlefields as well as the minds of the people of the north but none are as welcome as Konrow. An old curved horned folk of a dark bluish tones and a long braided beard sporting many a wooden charm,  Their arrival is always heralded by the soft chiming of wood staves hitting each other, as they have covered their horns, chest, arms and belt with over a hundred Fahtotems. 

They were a dedicated archivist of the rebellion and the people in it, spending the nights of marching and between battles carving the stories the others told them, hoping no fighter or friend would be forgotten. They have not spoken a word since the siege of the palace but seem determined to pass the Fahtotems to those who knew the subject of them, to reunite the stories with the communities they came from.

If you ever meet them it's kind to feed them and offer them respite. If you had someone you lost on the rebellion, tell them a tale of the one you lost and they will either offer you the Fahtotem you seek or cry with you for someone who is truly lost.
