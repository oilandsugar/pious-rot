We are now shortly after the defeat of the god of the ravaging tides and the hard-won victory of the uprising in the North. After the collapse of the placid palace, which came crashing down in the depths of the sea upon which it was standing, held together by accursed magic. After the ones that survived trekked back to their hometowns, a darkness and a kind of bitterness still persisted in the waves, the mountains and the forests of the northern lands, but also in the hearts of some folks who used to profit from the presence and power of the god.

Some of them used to be high mages of the godly court, draining the soul of the land and its creatures to conjure miracles of opulence, which were able to escape the collapse of their grand tower and disguise themselves as commoners. Others were scoundrels and raiders living on the rocky islands north east of the sea, taking advantage of the chaos left after the war and the reduced defenses of the villages dotting the shores to pillage and terrorize.
