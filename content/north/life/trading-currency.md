Multiple currencies are used to trade, pay for services or settle disputes in the north. But for most of the smaller mundane purchases, the folks of the north much prefer exchanging goods, time or skills and doing away with money altogether.

### Mokoon

Named after the moon, these circular coins are made from stamped bronze and bear its grinning face. This is the most valuable form of currency traded in the North outside of ingots or ore, and those seen using those or hoarding them are looked down upon by most folks.

### Beast stone (5 beasts equals a mokoon)

Carved stones representing common beasts roaming the northern lands. On their underside is carved a unique folk magic symbol meant to bring luck and wealth to the household in which the beast stone lives. They are commonly given as parting or wedding gifts and are more rarely traded for goods than other forms of currency.

### Kuin (10 coins equal a beast stone)

Small unmarked pewter coins. These are common across most of Thiusland and thus are preferred when trading with travelling merchants. Manipulating these coins often will turn your hands a greenish black color, which is a tell-tale sign of someone who trades more than crafts.

### Shell (20 shells equals to a kuin)

Small shells collected from the beaches, almost any shell works. These are not worth much but can be useful when playing games, or for keeping track of amounts owed at sea.
