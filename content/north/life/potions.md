Amongst the folks of the North is shared a long and complex tradition of salve-making and potion brewing using the myriad of wild mosses, seaweeds, reeds and tubers growing natively on the shores and in the high mountains.

### Restorative salve

One of the first salves that an herbalist will learn in their apprenticeship is the restorative salve, a thick mixture of wax, and ground mosses that accelerate the body’s healing process while inducing quite a bit of drowsiness. It is commonly believed that sleepiness is an unavoidable side-effect of the healing ingredients but in fact, a touch of soporific mushroom spores are usually added to make sure that whoever takes the salve doesn’t do more damage to their body while it heals.

**Effect:**  
Restores half of the player’s health points while inducing drowsiness for a long rest.

### Blue root tincture

Blue root is a large tuber that grows in frozen swamps, it grows extremely slowly during the few warmer months and hibernates during the remainder of the year. Few have the patience and dedication needed to find some and then wait for it to mature over the course of 2 to 3 years. But those who do are rewarded with an incredibly useful ingredient which gives deep sight when taken in a strong tincture.

**Effect:**  
Gives vivid hallucinations for a short rest, during which the player cannot fight or talk but detects nearby hidden enemies or treasure

### Pungent three-weed ointment

The three-weed ointment has a particularly bad reputation, almost as bad as the smell that exudes from folks who use it. But despite the rancid oily odour, some crafters and folks of less well-regarded profession use it to complete arduous precision tasks and pick especially intricate locks.

**Effect:**  
Increases dexterity and precision (making it easier to craft or lockpick) for a day but lowers charisma because of the stench.

### Boiled Lorn oils

Made from the oil that naturally covers the slick fur of the Lorn’s bodies, gently sponged off while the animals are feeding on scraps and leftover fish at night. The resulting yellowish liquid is then boiled and reduced to concentrate its effects. Once applied to surfaces or tools, the oils will reduce the friction between them to almost nothing. It is commonly used to ease the movement of contraption and to help lines glide more smoothly on sailing rigs.

**Effect:**  
Makes surfaces or tools extremely slippery.

### Kaindreth’s brew

Brewed with the most delicious of seaweeds for hours, this tasty potion is usually reserved for long negotiation or council sessions. It soothes the mind, gives clarity and eases understanding between folks of all walks of life.

**Effect:**  
Clears the mind, lowers bias and allows all players who partake in it to understand their respective language for as long as they keep drinking it.Must be shared by two or more people to have effect.

### Firesalt powder

Firesalt collected on the driest day of the year in the Lifir Saltpan and then crushed to a fine powder can be used to conjure small flames and is useful to start campfires. This folk practice does not require much magical knowledge and can be achieved by most. Although in the hands of a powerful folk magician, firesalt powder, especially if mixed with some rare flowers, can become a powerful weapon.


**Effect:**  
All players can use Firesalt powder to conjure short-live small flames or light a fire, players with more magical power can conjure fireballs of varying size and power.

### Cursing sour blood (forbidden)

Few in the North have the recipe for this foul ointment, and those who do are careful not to mention it. It is concocted by mixing one’s blood with graveyard soil and burnt sacred tree bark and letting the mixture rot for a whole moon cycle. This sour blood can then be used to cast a lasting curse upon a foe by pouring it under their bed or in their shoes.

**Effect:**  
Casts a curse that lasts for a month to the target if they don’t notice the blood the first day.

### Lifeblood distillate (forbidden)

Lifeblood distillate is a dark remnant of the god’s magick, it draws its power from the land and from your close friends and allies. It is distilled through a complicated process from the nectar of the oldest conifer trees growing atop the mountains and hairs or nail clippings from 5 of the practitioner’s closest relatives. Once consumed, it creates this rush of energy and endurance and an intense feeling of warmth and power rushing through someone’s veins. With this newfound stolen power, legends tell that one can build a castle in a day with only their bare hands.

**Effect:**  
Doubles strength and endurance for a day but weakens other party members and reduces the lifespan of the player by 10 years.
