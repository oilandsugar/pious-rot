Previously destroyed in fire to set an example, now a risen village, built anew in an act of defiance to the oppression and violence aimed at the people of the North. The town of Totindell has become a symbol for the rebellion, and is home to the Bitter End, a defensive pact against invasion from the Godlands of the west and south.

### Rumours

A magical scholar from the east, a halfling by the name of Winne, is attempting to create a spell that could reconstruct staves burnt in the fire of Totindell. Key components of the spell are a part of the stave with a legible rune and ash from the same area. Winne is willing to trade well for any brave enough to go to the undead beset ruins of old Totindell and collect these components.  

On the island east of the village fishers have been going missing, their boats found with a lighting patterned burn in their wood If found at all. One surviving Fisher said all they saw was a shadow in the sky, a high pitched screech and then they were in the water with their boat struck asunder.
