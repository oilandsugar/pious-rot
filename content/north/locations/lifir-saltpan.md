Near the salt water Lake of Liquid Fire is the culturally important saltpan of the North. The waters of the Lake contain a sulfuric element that’s spicy to the nose and warm to the touch, called [Firesalt](/north/life/potions/#firesalt-powder), that is a key component in a handful of common Northern folk spells that conjure or control fire. There are rumours there is an underwater cave system under the lake but swimming in the lake is near impossible due to the toxicity of raw Firesalt.
