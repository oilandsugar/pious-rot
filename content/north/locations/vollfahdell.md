The greenest land in all the north, the smell of pine in the air, and a cold wind off the mountains demark the town of Vollfahdell. The North understands the magic of the land and the damage done to it by the God’s extraction due to the nature calling of the Matriarch of Vollfahdell, who now leads the efforts to heal the land.

### Rumours

A droning wail can be heard on the wind in the forest of Fahorom, the beasts and the birds of the forest become aggressive and anxious at the sound, causing many injuries and even deaths to walkers in the woods. The wail carries on the winds from the Tusk Mountains but its source has not been found.  

In the land east of Vollfahdell towards the water a dead and hollow tree marches alone in the cover of night. The tree is named Ill and was once a great Eldar treant that had its soul stolen by a rite performed by the high priest of the God of Ravaging Tides. I'll now haunt the land and attack all who are near it. Those with knowledge of the druidic ways think Ill is a symptom of a greater rot in the area, but won't share this with the greater population.
