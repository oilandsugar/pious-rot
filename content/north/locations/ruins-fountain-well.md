When once the Placid Palace was imposed to relevance Fountain Well was fancied as the capital of the North. This large town accommodated trading to and from the various Godly Nations, travelers were welcome to numerous taverns and hospitality, all at the service of a tyrant lord. Now the lord is disposed of and the town lays abandoned, a stain reminiscent of dark days, by all folk of good will and morals. Talk around the tavern hearth says it is now the current den of Fjren the Eel Poacher.
