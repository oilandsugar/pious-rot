In the coldest areas of the North there is a pine tree that can live thousands of years, growing extremely slowly in the harsh Temperatures. The Eldhar pines are seen as sacred as any elder of the tribe in the North and as such are forbidden to be cut down. Yet, their wood is strong and seemingly resistant to rot when treated properly. The qualities of the wood make it a favorite for tool handles and carved circular recordings of personal histories called fahtotems. To acquire this, the hopeful go to the groves and sit under a tree to ask for a branch to fall for them to use, whatever falls for them is all that is given. Many fahtotems are returned to the bases of the trees when the carver dies, creating a historical library among the trees. 
If one takes a branch they bring a curse upon them, enacted by the dryads that inhabit the pines. If one fells a Eldar pine, they take its place, growing roots on the spot.
