West of Godrindell is a large forest of pines referred to as the Eldhar groves. It is a dark and dense forest filled with all manner of wild animals and birds and it is often blanketed with a thick fog that makes navigating the woods difficult.

In these groves can be found a species of large pine trees called the Eldhar pine that can live for thousands of years, growing extremely slowly in the harsh and cold climate. The Eldhar pines are considered as sacred as any elder of the tribe in the North and as such, are forbidden to be cut down. Yet, their wood is strong and seemingly resistant to rot when treated properly. The qualities of the wood make it a favorite for tool handles and carved circular recordings of personal histories called fahtotems. In order to acquire wood from these trees, the hopeful go to the groves and sit under a tree to ask for a branch to fall for them to use, whatever falls for them is all that is given. Many fahtotems are returned to the bases of the trees when the carver dies, creating a historical library among the trees. 
  
If one takes a branch they bring a curse upon them, enacted by the dryads that inhabit the pines. And the stories tell that if one fell an Eldar pine, they take its place, growing roots on the spot and turning into wood.
