The last stop in the west, a well fortified and hardened village standing as an oasis past dangerous roads from the south. The mark of the Craven sits on a dwelling here and the recent memory makes Kwandell distrustful of any who boasts like he did. Those who live here look to the sea for comfort, the crabs for inspiration and those who move here wish to be left alone.

### Rumours

The talk on everyone's tongue is the iron carriage that arrived at the early part of the season. From it came a thin human with delicate copper and bronze metal work adorning his arms, neck and legs and a large completely iron creature, wielding a weapon that looked like an anvil on a chain that was later decidedly a person inside though no one got a look at them. The thin man questioned the locals on many things, though his main interest was on the Mines of the Eel. Dawnwol whispered to the council that these people were from the southern city of the God of Gilded Scarcity and said they should not be trusted. After bidding the two to leave and a tense standoff in the town gate the two retreated to their carriage with the parting words “One does not need to believe in the power of metal for it to bind their fate”.
  
Dravendell has sat empty since the war against the god and the younger, more adventurous of Kwandell have been warned to keep away from the empty homes that now play home to large land tusk, though they never listen. A year past however one child of 12 returned from there with a strange and painful burn, saying that in the old church of the Five Gods a person covered in white ash spoke to them in words they did not know and cast magic that burned them. Even the adventurous have kept away since.
