The Cliffs of the Kraken are to be found on an volcanic island north of the cold sea. 
The island has high cliffs with multiple caves underneath. The name referencing the Kraken is from the strange rock formations that flow from the cave mouths under the cliff’s edge. Long ago the island’s volcano erupted and a vicious stream of lava met the cold crashing waves it left tentacle-like remnants. More recently the caves are used by smugglers and worshippers of the old gods in hiding, the only ones desperate enough to hope that the fires of the volcano never return.
