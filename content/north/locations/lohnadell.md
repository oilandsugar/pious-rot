With lingering morning fog on the lake, fields of northern cotton at its outskirts and lace like lichen south.as far as the eye can see, Lohnadell is known as the home in the clouds. While none of its community marched on the Placid Palace the people of Lohnadell held off a brigade of mercenaries from the plains in the war against the Gods and a memorial to the town's defenders stands at the southern entrance.

### Rumours

The Bowfish of the nests to the north shore Lagos were a trouble during the war against the god. On the day of the death of the God of Ravaging Tides they all screamed in unison and stopped their attack on Lohnadell. While they have become reclusive, they still attack any Fisher who comes too close to their shore or their muddy nests. All attempts to welcome the Bowfish to the community of Lohnadell or an independent part of the new communal system have been rebuffed, so they are kept well enough alone. So it's strange when word came through the stubehall of Lohnadell that a young Bowfish has been seen playing with a child of Bonr’ok.
  
No one listened to the eldest woman in Lohnadell, Katrol, when she warned of the face of Lagos before but now 50 defenders of Lohnadell swear they saw a watery mouth and nose break out of the ice and swallow the 300 mercenaries pursuing them. Since then the old ways have returned, in which you never walk over the ice of Lagos when the sky is clear and snow is sparse lest you obscured the face’s view from the depth, a sure way to anger it, and you always give the face a part of your spirits or food if you sail over it's waters on a clear day.
