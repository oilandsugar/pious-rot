Rarely does one place see as much death as Hondle pass. It was always a chosen graveyard for the Giant Crabs to come to on the first day of winter. More recently it became the final resting place of many Northerns fighting for their freedom. 
  
The Gambit of Hondle pass was made by the Determined Few fighting against the Guardians of God, greatly outnumbered and weakened, the Few devised a plan using the bottleneck of the pass and to the Crab’s yearly funeral procession. As the Guardians marched through carcasses of Crabs and live Crabs alike the Northerns struck from hiding and caused them to fear, a panicked Guardian struck a crab and the chittering roar brought the crabs to frenzy. In the chaos the Guardians fled to the upper pass to escape but right into the waiting Few and their forces. 
  
The bloody history of the pass has made it a spot one usually avoids unless paying respect, however it must be used by loggers in the summer to reach the conifer groves in the mountains. If someone must travel through Hondle it is customary to set up a fire and leave an empty space at it with food and drink at the ready, for the dead who still linger and have a story to tell.
