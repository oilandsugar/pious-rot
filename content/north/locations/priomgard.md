The original creators of Thiusland were the Elves, who have long since left the physical lands of the continent for the otherworld, but still watch the people and the place they love through liminal places called Elfmoots. For most the Elfmoots are oddities and sacred sites, but for the elf touched they are some of the last places where they can commune with their ancestors. Since the coming of the Gods many of the Elfmoots have been diminished and corrupted by the use of soul magic.
  
In the north there's a pond of water that is not fed by any river or reaches any ocean but its waters are clear as glass and cleaner than the glacial drip. In the time of spring and summer the spring is surrounded by flowers of a multitude of colour otherwise unseen in the north, kept by butterflies that arrive from the south. There's a patch of thunderevel that grows in the garden that is watched by a Skyfire Sloth but the creature and all that visit the pond only feel a sense of calm, never violence.
  
In this time of bloom at the crossing of twilight an elf can be seen in the reflection of the pond, tending to the flowers and looking over the beauty of the garden. 
  
Healers often come to the pond to collect waters for their practice, as the water carries no sickness and disease. 
  
In the winter a figure of an elf is frozen over the dried out basin of the pond.
