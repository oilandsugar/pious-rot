Said to be the first town on the northern coast, built from stones carried down from the mountains. Rumours also tell of the bones of an ancient giant kept in the stores of its common hall protecting it from raiders and pillagers.

Comfortably lodged at the intersection of two large fjords on the western side of the North Sea is the small but quite famous town of Godrindell. Most of this fame comes from the legend of Beldonis, an erudite in the nuanced art of folk healing and intrepid fisher; her exploits and knowledge left a mark on the small sea-side town. Now a thriving outpost acting as a link in the long and winding trade route coming up from the central plains to the mountains of the North. It is the home of a multitude of folk magic and healing practitioners, continuing the tradition of preserving the rich diversity of sacred seaweeds, water tubers and mosses that cover the land and the sea of these cold and unforgiving shores.

The first stone of Godrindell was laid more than 500 years ago by the descendants of those who came during the long expedition led by the Elder. Originally boat builders, they had to adapt their craft to build habitations that would resist the freezing winds with the few resources available around, chiefly a dark grey stone. Small groups still venture up the treacherous passes up in the mountains during the coldest nights to cut and gather large logs to be used in the construction of boats, tool handles and carved magical staves used to protect the homes and grant good luck and clear sight to the fishermen.

Like most of the towns of the North, it is populated by a wide variety of folks. Both long-time inhabitants and newcomers don’t often share stories of their past, not a lot of value is attached to stories of past fame or regal heritage in those lands, the same way as past wrongdoings can be pardoned if accountability is shown.
