### Rumours

Near town stands a stone that rises well above any human and even some giants, in a divot, as if dropped from the sky. The Stone has holes in it that many birds find roost, and is storied to be the inspiration for the now numerous towers of Teredell.
The tower-making prowess of the masons of Teredell is widely known, so much so that they have been hired by the eastern bogs to erect one there. Any willing and able to guard the caravan to the east are welcome for good compensation.
