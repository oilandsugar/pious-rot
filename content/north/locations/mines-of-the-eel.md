Avoided by most and feared by many, the mines of the eel are still visited by master blacksmiths and travelling merchants looking for strong iron, and even stronger alcohol. Some say that the eel has been dead for long, or even never existed and the whole story made up by the dwarves for keeping undesirables away.

As is commonly known all mines in the land are overseen by the Holy Consortium of Metallurgists but what truth that holds belies an exception. There is one mine that holds no alliance or treaty with the Consortium, but it is on an island in the far North. The island is not much more than a hill and cliff in its entirety, but inside it's stones lie pure iron for crafters, collected by the dwarves. The dwarves did not make the main vein of tunnels however, only the ones branching off from it, for this main shaft is the chosen home of a truly gigantic Eel.

The Eel seemingly dug a tunnel system from the water below to the top of the island, using its acidic blood to carve a perfectly cylindrical tunnel into the rocks. It did so seemingly purely to stare at the sky. Every time no moon is seen in the night sky is when the Eel emerges from the depths and holds its massive head high. These days are seen as holy to the dwarves of the mountain, all work ceases and it is custom to burn offerings below the Eel, though it takes no notice. The only time the dwarves actually may truly engage with the Eel is when it surfaces it will eat anyone that stands in the main tunnel. The dwarves see a death of this nature to be just and will carve a relief of anyone consumed in the wall of the outer cliff to live forever as part of the great Eel Lord’s domain.

Anyone who trades for the iron of the Eel dwarves must give one of their clan to the Eel and bring an offering to burn on each trade; those who don’t follow the customs are refused entry to the upper cliffs of the island.
