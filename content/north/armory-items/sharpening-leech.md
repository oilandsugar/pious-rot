In the waters of the cold North there’s a fearsome creature known as a Sovereign Eel. This creature lays longer than 10 men and has the power to control the mind of its prey to make them easier to hunt. The young Sovereign Eel are like a leech who learned to detect when a creature’s mind was not its own and swarm to feed first on  the blood of a captured creature in safety. Many wore a leech behind their ear in battle with the Gods and let the bites save them from subjugation. For the service of their young the Sovereign Eel are no longer hunted, a sacred ally in the north.
