The tribe of the northern sea are well known for their quartz tools but the adze of Bron Teareth was unique. Harder than any iron but hollow, filled with water from the days of the ancient elementals, untouched by man or God. The clear blade shines with the bracken of a forgotten and chaotic age. All present attest the retreat at [Hondle Pass](/north/locations/hondle-pass) would have been a massacre if not for the Equal Plane and the heroism of Bron Teareth. One bard wrote in the song ‘Heroes die in Hondle’; “Who would you bet on? God or Shipwright. It was a battle won not with brawn, but by the simple man not giving up the fight”

### The Equal Plane  

**Axe** (d8 damage)  
**Legendary item**  
**Invaluable**  

This impressive tool turned weapon cuts into flesh as well as it cuts into wood, deadly in close chopping range, especially when held in two hands to chop down.  
The properties of the water trapped in the tool take effect when exposed to magic. If the wielder is subjected to ill effects of a spell the Equal Plane will shield them and negate the effects somewhat, turning the magic from pain to a revitalizing effect.
