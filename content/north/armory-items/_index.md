Wooden, bronze and iron tools and weapons are previous items in the north and are either made by the craftsperson who intends to to use it or acquired from a toolmaker. Not much distinction is made between tools for working the land or catching fish and tools of battle for warriors of profession are very few and far between in these parts and if the need arises to fight, most folk use or modify their existing tools for the purpose.
