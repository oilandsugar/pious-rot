Also known as “the Hook that caught a God”, the Ragged Grasp to the unlearned looks nothing much more than a serrated grasp hook. This weapon was used by one of the Determined Few in their battle for liberation. It’s unique not for how it catches its target but how it leaves the target once they are free of its grasp. Loran-Keth was rumoured to polish the hook with the blood of Eels, there’s no method in the ballads of the effect but the metal’s unique tint might be because of this.

### The Ragged Grasp (of Loran-keth)
Is a spiked hook that is either affixed to an arm or a wooden handle, it can hit a foe you are directly facing with ease. The power of the Ragged Grasp isn’t in its broad hit but in the inner spikes.
Once struck by the hook the foe will be grabbed by the hooks and struggle to get free, but a strong foe would be able to. However, when freeing something from the Ragged Grasp the hooks tear and leave a wound behind.
