The North, named as such as it’s the highest point north of the Continent of Thiusland, has a tundra-like environment, and is covered in snow for the majority of 6 months of the year. Large impenetrable glaciers and ice flows dominate the northern ocean but the bay of the northern sea gives ample water for sea life as well as the fishers of the Northern people to thrive.
