Most people not living or coming from the North share a belief that the food eaten by the Northerners is bland and austere. This belief melts away very quickly once someone gets a bite of steamed salty seaweed stew with a side of roasted huran root.

## Huran Root

In the North, mountain streams run to strong rivers that feed into the cold sea, and within these estuaries grows a staple of Northern culture. The Huran root, a purple knotted root that often grows in a mangled Y shape, has been cultivated in the north since days were recorded. At the edge of estuaries the Northerners wall small pools with stone and plant the Huran inside, usually in summer. The Huran will grow slowly and bud in the spring, just in time for the Coccurnir fish to lay eggs around the stocks, providing shelter for the eggs and eventually food when they hatch. The adult Coccurnir die off, providing fertile ground for the next year’s planting. The Huran Root is then harvested, two branches of the Y cut and one left to grow anew. 

Huran Root is known for its starchy nature  and nutty flavour. It’s most often enjoyed fully roasted with seafood, milled into a flour that makes breakfast dumplings, or distilled with flowers for a delightful, despite belly-fire conjuring, alcohol. 

## Tae-to paste

Northerners are known as hard and hardy people but that does not mean they are without delights. One of which is Tae-to, a devilishly addictive paste made of the boiled leftover innards of crab after being shelled, a sprig of bear primsey, and mushrooms left to ferment for a moon’s  cycle. It’s to be enjoyed with huran root, crab, and even on bear meat by some of the more adventurous. 

There’s a variation, Sacred Tae-to, replacing the crab with the marrow of a skyfire sloth. This was reserved for the Gods until the fall of the Placid Palace, but now after liberation it’s given commonly as a wedding gift.

## Ruck Poppers 

The sea is a cruel place for many waking creatures but it has been known at times to be kind. One such kindness is the Ruck, a type of sea plant found in the north with branching tendrils adorned with fruit akin to a bead. These Ruck Poppers have a bright and sour note with a lingering sweetness. They are enjoyed in bowls after being streamed with flowers of various breeds and tastes to compliment. 

The most enjoyed accompanying flower is one from the Thunder Revel plant, however this flower only blooms in a storm and oft a patch already claimed by the sky fire sloth. Some brave or stupid do not let that dissuade them, keeping alive the dead god’s motto of “Death for Decadence”.
