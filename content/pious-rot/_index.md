## Foreword

Welcome to the setting of Pious Rot, a world of morally bankrupt gods and heroics from the everyday person. This book is intended to give you culture, history and questlines for your roleplaying games. It is the first of many books that will build out a unique setting that captures a world that focuses on trade, cultural exchange and exploration. We highly support porting the locations and into your own worlds and building upon them. 
The basis of Pious rot is inspired by bronze era European civilizations, animistic beliefs and lost folk traditions of Europe, the setting deals with cultural strife, fighting subjugation, deicide, and what it takes to build a new society after freedom.  We include all peoples, sexualities, and genders in our setting as a belief that all people deserve representation in fantasy settings, racism and bigotry has no place in our world.
