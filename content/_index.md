Welcome to the setting of Pious Rot, a world of morally bankrupt gods and heroics from the everyday person. This book is intended to give you culture, history and questlines to your roleplaying games. It is the first of many books that will build out a unique setting, we also highly support porting the locations and into your own worlds and building upon them. 
Weâ€™ve based much of our inspiration on bronze era European civilizations and lost folk traditions of Europe, the setting deals with cultural strife, subjugation and deicide.
