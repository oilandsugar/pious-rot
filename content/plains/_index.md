The Central Plateau, known more commonly as the Plains, is called such because it forms the central area of the Continent of Thiusland and is located primarily on a large flat plateau. It is also the largest sprawling grassland of the region. The plains are bordered on the north and west by forest and mountains cleaved by rivers that make their way into the plains. The eastern parts are covered by long grasses that make way to rolling hills and then impressive mountain ranges, while the south transforms into badlands and scrublands. The plateau has a temperate grassland environment with 4 well defined seasons of equal length spanning the wheel of the year, an important aspect in the life of the farming and animal rearing folks that call it home.
