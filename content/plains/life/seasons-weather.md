## On the surface

Ever since the great fire that consumed the central plains, some fires are still burning in the soil creating a dull fog and plumes of smoke to cover most of the fields. The godrent bodies decompose to a sickly oil that still feeds the fires. A combination of smoke partially blocking the sun and fire burning in the ground has made the different seasons almost blend into each other and disrupted the normal cycles of growth, decay and rebirth that used to define the climate of the plains.

## In the tunnels

### Hirbehn - spring

The spring is felt in the caves by way of the litters of burrowing rodents that are born and nibble on the root farms, as well as the last herds, new calves and kids the giants keep. Fresh waters from ice melts find their way into the cracks and openings of various caverns and the time comes for the Seed Shepherds to set off on the surface once more for the year.

### Silvehn - summer

Summer is hot in the central plains and the greenhouse effect of the Ashen skies makes that heat linger. However, the caves stay cool and temperate in the summer all the same. The underground aquifers sustain water supplies as some of the surface streams dry up and the herds take to the cool cave shelter more readily.

### Arbehn - autumn

The rainstorms of Autumn brings many floods into the entrances of the caverns but the years have allowed the giants to divert the waters to where they can be contained in this wet season. This is also the harvests for the mushroom farms at the start and the beginning of the Preservers work to jar for the winter.

### Torbehn - winter

Winter is an exciting season in the Roots of the Earth as many insects come to live and nest in the depths while the world above freezes or chills. Many delight at the activity the migration brings as they stay inside and the Seed Shepherds return.go show what has been found and to bring news of the world above.
