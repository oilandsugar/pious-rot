The curative, sometimes destructive and enhancing powers of Preserver family's fermentations has been known to the people of the plains but after the Scorching Fields new powers in these practices have appeared. The Dire Resurrection and Farmer family look to heal the very soul of the giants but in their own unique ways.

### Dark eye tincture 

Made from the venom of different types of colorless spiders living in total obscurity, this tincture is applied directly to the eyes to grant the person an exceptionally good vision in the dark.

**Effect:**  
Allows 12 hours of the ability to see in the dark for 100 feet ahead of you, though any bright light from the sun will be overwhelming and blinding to the affected.

### Yohl’s Fuming brew

Originally used for keeping bees away when harvesting honey on the plains, the giants repurposed this brew that produces a thick smoke to clear caves and tunnels of aggressive or destructive bugs.
  
**Effect:**  
Throw or place on a spot to create a 20 foot radius cloud of thick smoke that obscures vision for those who rely on sight. Insects in this cloud must flee in the safest direction possible.

### Inlinehn oil

Pressed from a rare moss growing in the deepest caves, where the warmth of the depth can be felt through the walls. The resulting yellow oil is very staining and when applied to metal tools and blades will heat them up to a red glow without dulling their edge or softening the iron. Tools treated that way make the process of carving and cutting stone much easier, which can only make one imagine what effect those would have on flesh and armor.
  
**Effect:**  
When applied to a bladed or wedged tool all work done by that tool is finer, and when applied to a weapon all cuts or punctures by that weapon go deeper. This effect lasts 1 hour from application, it takes about a minute to properly coat a weapon.

### Fortifying Syrup

The honey of the ignis bee is a sought after delight but when fermented, a process the bees do to feed the honey to their young naturally, the honey’s true talents are revealed. The syrup not only heals the drinker of minor cuts and infections they endure but seems to toughen the skin of the drinker so they are less likely to be cut or bruised for an hour after drinking.

**Effect:**  
When drunk it cures all bacterial diseases, heals surface wounds immediately, hastens the setting of bones and reduces damage the drinker would take by a small amount for 1 hour.

### Ashen offering 

The Dire Resurrection family has many rituals to pry life from death’s embrace, one such they use to bring a fallen member back from a recent death. They bury the family member on a plot they keep, and burn their earthly belongings in a bonfire above their body. When it's fallen to embers they place their hand in the fire and call the name of the fallen to guide their soul back to their body. Once returned they must be quickly exhumed. This ritual must take place within 5 days of their death or the soul is too far to be called.

**Effect:**  
One creature that has died within 5 days may be buried in a land they kept or improved and all their current possession at the time of death must be placed in a fire over their buried body, the fire must consume all their possession for the ritual to work. Once complete they will return to life tired and hurt but alive.

### Curse protection bottle

The Dire Resurrection family understands the spirit magic of the gods better than any on the plains and from the magical scars they've seen or the misguided that wield it they know it's best to protect yourself from it. They do so by carrying a sprouted seed in a bottle, worn as a necklace, that protects from curse but the seedling inside of it dies having its soul drained instead of any part of you own. 

### Anchoring Shard

The Farmers of Lonnol caverns found the quartz there to be a deeply resonate vessel for the land itself and endeavour to return the lost and fragmented souls of their kin into the quartz to replenish the soul of the land. They do this by long meditations with the quartz but a trinket has been made for those brave enough to venture to the surface. The process is you must remove a knuckle bone from a hand and bury it in the quartz chamber and then place a shard of quartz on the finger the bone was from. When a maligned spirit is subdued by the wearer then can capture and send the spirit to the quartz below from this link as if they were meditating at the chamber itself.
