With the loss of the plains forests the need of wood is great with no options for the giants to gather it on their own. This need as well as their shared struggle against the tyranny of the gods has kindled a strong trade partnership with the North, who greatly appreciate the heavy and water resistant boiled wool of the giants, as well as their more sweet vitals.
  
The snakewalkers in the east have a long relationship of sharing healing practices with the giants and have many uses for the poisonous mushrooms that grow in the dark depths of the world and happily provide seeds from their hills in exchange for these.
And, while the relationship is contentious at times, the Pullulate give fresh vegetables from their fields on surface for some of the preserves and clay works of the giants, though all trade is done through human family members as giants are labeled as defacto criminals in the south and any southern agents in the Sprouts would gladly bring them in.
  
Despite being underground the giants do not carve new tunnels in fear of collapsing their network and thus they have no easy access to metal and will happily trade for any metals. The collect these in clay vessels shaped like Bison, Sheep or Gnarlticks and once filled the family chooses what tool to make from the metal.
