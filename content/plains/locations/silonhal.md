The southern entrance to the Roots of the Earth and the home of the Shepherd family. The most recently discovered cavern home gave the Roots a southern entrance, one that the Shepherd’s saw as needing a strong defense. Any traveller entering through Sillonhal is heavily questioned and eyed with suspicion. The shepherds hope to return to their herding lifestyle as soon as they can, building out a fortress from their cavern entrance looking to hold their claim to the surface through might and will.

### Rumours

Shepherds want to roam and this instinct is not lost on their children. To try their best to keep their children near the home the Shepherds tell many stories of wolves in the night, spiders in the tunnels and trolls in the badlands. The problem with this is the true mix with the cautionary, and the all too real Trolls are thought of as imaginary. There are 5 of them, large, round faced, flat board and blue. They have no Ill intention but they're curiosity gets the best of them and they have been known to abduct giants to ask them endless questions and are quick to anger if their curiosity is not entertained.   

The Harvest Scythe is hellbent on bringing the giants who raided the outskirts of their encampment, giants who proudly wore the symbol of the Shepherds. Currently the Harvest Scythe is too weak to attack but there is talk on the roads of a southern mercenary company marching their way to the plains. Gnellik won't move any guards from the fortress so is looking for sympathetic outsiders to scout and sabotage this meeting.
