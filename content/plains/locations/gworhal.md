The cavern home of the Bison family, closest cavern to the hall of season. The Bison lost much of their original purpose and now oversee the relations of the giants with the Gnarlticks and other insects of the tunnels. There's a deep basin valley exiting off their western tunnels that houses the last of the families bison and a stables of dunkrit for the families to utilize, helping the far off Gerhollow connect with the Hall and the greater giant communities.

### Rumours

The large and smooth walls of Gworhal are an oddity in the Roots of the Earth, they run for a long section, as if dug by a large creature, but seemingly start and end abruptly. Recently Barckul, a druid from the Hall of Seasons, inspected the cavern end and was able to tell the stone had been magically shaped to close the tunnel, and that moved the stone to reveal the tunnel continued past it deeper into the earth. Fondogsan said it was best left alone but Barckul is obsessed with the mystery, wanting to find what made the tunnel and if it was the same person or thing that sealed it magically.  

The last foray into the Field of Ash brought strange news: The Ghost Herd had returned. For centuries Bison would see the herd as they died and join it in passing. What has changed however is the Herd’s countenance, once a solemn parade of ghostly bison the herd now stampedes in a fearsome purpose. Gobpar lesser was unfortunate enough to have failed to flee in time from the stampede and when it had passed he rose aged as if three decades, hair white as morning mists. Gobpar greater now calls out to all healers to attempt to bring his son back to his rightful age.
