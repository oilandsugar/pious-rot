The cavern home of the Gardener family, a wonder in agriculture.Adapting to the reality of the depths of the earth in their own home the Gardeners utilize wood and bone pits to grow large mushroom gardens below the surface, which are carefully curated to avoid toxic and rank mold from developing. The white web of mycelium covers much of the tunnels there giving the walls an almost cloth like look in the low light of the bioluminescent mushrooms.

### Rumours

Shrewbats of the Cave Organ keep to themselves during the day and fly through the caverns at night, but oddly during the night there's been sightings of a large bat that stays in the Cave Organ that walks like a human. There's suspicion from the older members of the family who go too early and never have seen it, could it just be shadows playing tricks in the dim light? But no one can argue a normal Shrewbat could have made the large bite on Dokelli’s neck.   

In the plains when Giants tended the diverse plants of the land there was one prized above the rest. The Panacea Flower was prized for its ability to heal any poison or even magical curse it was ever used on. It was notoriously sensitive to the environment and the Gardeners think there's no chance it has survived in the ashy lands above, but any Seed Shepherd that finds one alive or dead will be a hero to the Gardener family.
