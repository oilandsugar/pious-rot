The cavern home of the Preserver family and first of the giant’s cave settlements in the Roots of the Earth as the entrance originally served as the storage for the family's vast stores of preserves. Once the center of giant life underground it now sits far from the Hall of seasons and other families. It stays active by way of its access to the surface, key for trade access to the north, one of the few caverns with inns for travellers and an outpost for excursions into the eastern field.

### Rumours

The river in the eastern exit of Gworhollow has a bridge expertly crafted of stone over it in a massive cavern that looks as if the ground was split but only from below. A carving in old dwarvish adorns the ends of the bridge that states “The Slithering Geyser made this place and keeps it, tread with respect lest you anger our host”.  

The Broad Pillow, the largest and well kept Inn of Gerhollow’s trade entrance, is well kept and comfortable for the traveller in need of a rest. However, guests who have a hard time sleeping might run into Raggity, the skeleton that cleans the halls and tends the entrance overnight. No one knows why Raggity-Bones is there but any attempt to get them to leave seems to distress the skeleton and they buy no means harm anyone, if anything they're a great help to the inn. They rest during the day at the entrance of the inn, a waving hand at attention of a seemingly non animated skeleton.
