The North Eastern entrance to the Roots of the Earth, though one would miss it if they didn't know where to go between massive roots of ancient trees, a protection granted by an ages old friendship. Herfielhal almost rejects its place in the stone by its wood columned halls and green paved floors that the Arborists need for any sense of comfort in their new home. While the way in is too hidden for trade it allows the Arborists access to the forest they are seeding in the north west and the field there as well as branches to the Gnarltick tunnels in the west.

### Rumours

The Roots of the Earth is a safe bastion to keep the fragile giant community together, and so the entrances are guarded carefully. In the north the entrance is protected by the Bark Liege, a massive treant who dwarfs even the giants and is said to have known the elemental giants of old. The Bark Liege’s roots hide the entrance from anyone he does not know and keeps the Arborist home safe.  

Warning: Strange humans have been seen at the western forest edge, reports say when approached they attempted to converse while seemingly trying to lure the giant closer. They are considered untrustworthy and should be avoided, as they have been identified as God Fearing enemies of the giants. - a notice posted in the commons of Herfielhal.
