In the deeper corridors of Argenol there’s a staircase to the gem walled caverns of Lonnol, home of the Farmer family, the part of the family who stayed in the Roots of the Earth. The deepest settlement in the Roots of the Earth. The Farmers tend to the gems that jut out of their cavern walls as a lifelong effort to aid their growth. They also practice a kind of meditation in these chambers that are empty of all other trappings.

### Rumours

The Giants keep their history and the history of the animals and plants of the plains by way of speaking with them and converting the tales to craft; painted, carved and woven tablets preserve the history of the plains. Recently, however, the Druids of the farmer family have heard the stones of their cavern homes speaking to them. Their memory is ancient and their concept of time is not apparent but the stones speak of histories giants have yet known. They now request any Menhir or Standing stones from the Ashen lands to attempt to hear their memories and record the lost giants that used to keep them.  

The Roots of the Earth keep the giants safer than the Field of Ash but they are not completely safe themselves. So far Xygrids and husks are the most terrible things met in the depths, but usually they are confined to the caverns below the field. But, in the dark depths of Lonnol, deeper than any cavern, something dark stirs in a now sealed tunnel off the cavern home. The original seeker who found the tunnel never returned, those who searched for her heard a terrible chattering and saw the wall writhe before quickly retreating from the tunnel. If not for the gems of the cave Lonnol would have been entirely abandoned, but for now the Farmer family live near a terror they hope is unable to find them.
