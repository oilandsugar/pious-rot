The great herds of bison on the plains were famous and the key meat for the endless feasts of the former God king. Many Shepherds kept a social understanding of herds, merging and leading together. The last vestiges of these great herds can be found in magic bells affixed to the top of a cane. The one who held it last was bandaged, scarred, and for all purposes mute. Their rhythmic shake of the bells call forth the memories of better days for the plains, when life thrived.

As an action you may cast a 50 ft square illusion of a herd of bison. The herd is considered difficult terrain. As a bonus action you can move the heard to a point within 20ft horizontally, any creature within 10ft of that point must make a DC 15 intelligence saving throw or immediately use its reaction, if available, to move away from the heard as far as it's movement will allow. A creature that uses an action to examine the herd can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on a DC 15 intelligence (investigation) check.  
The herd dissipates after 1 hour or if dispelled.  
You regain this ability at the end of a long rest.
