With the Central Plains reduced to unbearable ash the Giant-kin were forced to retreat and rely on their cave homes. As they dig deeper and wider to make a new life underground they disturbed the chitinous denizens of the deep. After a year of war what could of be a rekindling of deadly fire was quenched by calmer heads. The two groups found symbiosis through a mutual respect. The giants now live in the tunnels built by the insects and the insects feed off their dead. To seal this union a tool was made, one that allows the two cultures a closer understanding.
