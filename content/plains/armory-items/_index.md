The giants of the plains craft much from wood, clay, wool, leather and linseed but metal is a rarity and cared for greatly, to compensate for metal many substitutions have been made with carved horn and chiton of various insects. Weapons are not a part of Giant culture, only recently have the Shepherds built weapons, many of their historic relics are simple farming implements and the magic foci for the natural, primal magic the Giants call upon.
