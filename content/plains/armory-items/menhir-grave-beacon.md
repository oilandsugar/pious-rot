As many of the plains have resigned themselves and persevere in the hardships of their new reality, there are some that refuse to let the old ways die. These nomads of the broken land use a magic to call beyond the veil of death, to pull the spirits of those killed on the land to come forward and bring it life anew. The process may seem diabolical but the spirits are to give consent, and a life given to sustain another is not something to lament. However, there are times where a spirit is too angered or shattered and will become violent to those who summon it. If these violent spirits are left to live, they will carry on a reclamation of their own design.
