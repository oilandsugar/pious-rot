The plows of the central plains are mostly led by cattle but the peoples of the plains are as strong as any beast of burden, and Dongar preferred to do the work himself. The battle of Reaver Valley was an early victory for the plains giants and many ballads point to Dongar as the key. The forces of god knew death was near when the ground began to shake, Dongar is remembered as a tidal wave on land, leading his plow in and shattering enemy lines. It’s mostly stone design kept up in the inferno, and the handles petrified in a strange magic.
