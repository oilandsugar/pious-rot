The giants lost many things on the scorching field fires but many held seeds that need to be replanted and carried for on the surface. Many vile creatures walk the accursed earth and so the Seed Shepards carry a tool to ensure nothing dangerous awaits them on their way by surprise. Holding a piece of Gnarltick Chiton pierced by iron in a curved K, they hold this to the ground or roof of the caves to divine if any creature walks above or nearby. Legged beasts deliver a rhythmic beat while the slither of a Briar Herder is far more dull and sinister.
