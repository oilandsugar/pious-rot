After the destruction left of the once verdant plains, many found themselves far displaced from where they once called home. In defiance of this tragedy the giants of the plains collected herbs, grains and dirt from their homes, infusing them in a pouch, giving any a scent to ground then in times of great dysphoria and reminding them of their great history. A family will give this to the younger members when they have chosen to break off from the home and either venture off to Seed Shepherd or persue their life in a different family. It’s so common a tradition that one rarely sees these stewards of the lost lands without a pouch on their persons while walking about abroad.
