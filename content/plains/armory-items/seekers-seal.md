Exploring the unmapped tunnels of the Roots of the Earth can be incredibly dangerous, the depths hide many forgotten horrors and new ones seep in from the corrupted surface. The Tunnel Seekers who take on this task come from all families and must train in various ways to keep themselves safe in their duties. One key item in this is a pressed clay puck with a seed embedded into it, the seed is then enchanted to grow into a vine watered by the wearer’s sweat that wraps on the hand the puck is placed and wraps up their arm. Once bonded the Seeker can use the vine to strike out at danger, grab holds to steady themselves and grab things that fall into cracks they might not be able to reach. Once the Seeker’s journey is over many keep the vine in their plots but others allow it to grow with them, some to the point of their entire arm being covered in a wrapping vine.
