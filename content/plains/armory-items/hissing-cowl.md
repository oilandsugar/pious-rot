The Giants have found a home in the caves of the Gnarltick but the space has not been shared without it’s fights. Gnarlticks are smart but in their core they are creatures, and are slaves to the whims of seasons and smells. Certain times of the season the Gnarlticks will get aggressive if blocked in the tunnels or certain scents will send them to a rage, if this occurs the Giants call for a Hissing Cowl. A leather cowl created to inflate and hiss like the neck of a bull Gnarltick, the offend creature reacts as if scolded by a parent and quickly deescalates.
